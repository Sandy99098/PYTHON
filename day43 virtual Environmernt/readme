A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained directory tree that includes a Python installation and a number of additional packages. Different applications can then use different virtual environments. To create a virtual environment, you can use the venv module that comes pre-installed with Python 3.3 and above1.

<!-- to activate virtual environment -->
